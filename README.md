# Yash-Cassinos luckiest number-
This Game Developed by me in  C++  libraries  in my first year of college.  This game is developed to test  luck +  mental ability of its user and I am soon going to create its app version.
This game uses **c++ libraries** such as ctime and cstdlib(to use random numbers). It is basically a casino like all other casinos in which you users have to first enter some depository amount and then you have to guess the number on which you want to bet and place some amount of money from your depository account as bet more money you bet more will you earn as return but if you loose you will lose all money that you have placed as bet . If you have guessed the correct number then you will won some money on the basis of amount you have entered as reward and if you lose the bet i.e. if you have guessed wrong number then you losses all money that you have placed as bet. In this game I have tried my best to give this game users some **new experience** in which _users_ will first get 3  chances to guess a number randomly chosen by system using 'srand' functions of 'cstdlib' libraries and it will also give users various hints after each incorrect **guess** and in this way if they failed to guess the number after these three trials then they can use hint option provided by system and in this hint function they will get a problem statement which will be solved  using general mathematics and this will judge their **mental ability**. And **more the chances you take less amount you will win in return and if you take hint then the more hints you take out of 3, more percentage of money on you have deposited as bet you will lose.**
